## Background
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first list of deep learning papers on medical applications. There are couple of lists for deep learning papers in general, or computer vision, for example [Awesome Deep Learning Papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers.git). In this list, I try to classify the papers based on their deep learning techniques and learning methodology. I believe this list could be a good starting point for DL researchers on Medical Applications. 

## Criteria

1. A list of **top deep learning papers** published since 2015.
2. Papers are collected from peer-reviewed journals and high reputed conferences. However, it may have recent papers on arXiv. 
3. A meta-data is required along with the paper, i.e. Deep Learning technique, Imaging Modality, Area of Interest, Clinical Database (DB).
